# BenchmarkEmail API Client/Library for Java

BenchmarkEmail.com Java Wrapper supports most of the API methods listed in [API documentation](http://www.benchmarkemail.com/API/Doc).

Originally inspired by [BenchmarkEmail.com's Java Wrapper](http://www.benchmarkemail.com/API/Download)
and improved with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Spring Framework](http://spring.io/) support 
and general refactoring using modern Java programming best practices.
